email-verification-script
=========================

.py code for an email template to verify key data points from respondents for publication for reports at the Chronicle of Philanthropy. The code for this email applies to participants included in the 2014 Foundations report.

It details how to create the email template, how to fill the email template with unique participant information, how to join the participant information with the correct, corresponding participant email, and how to send out the email to all participants.

One note: Email information is removed for privacy reasons. Additionally, because of server issues limiting the number of emails I could send in a batch (5), I would revise this script to add a timer function.
